    <h2> <strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>A baked dish originating in Italy, which consists of a flat, round, crispy leavened dough covered with a layer of sauce and a layer of one or more toppings, such as meat, seafood, vegetables, and fruit, which is often topped with a layer of cheese. A popular dish served for all types of occassions and meals, Pizza is made as a sweet or a savory food that can be enjoyed as a breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, or snack.

        Traditionally, Pizza is often considered to be a savory food made into a round shape and cut into wedges for serving. However, as foods change, Pizza has evolved to be formed into round, rectangular and square shapes with a wide variety of ingredients being used to make the toppings for the baked crust. Sweet pizzas are often served for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dessert, or as an appetizer while the savory varieties are most often served for lunch, dinner, or as a snack.
        
        When reheating previously cooked Pizza, preheat the oven to 350ºF to 400ºF. While waiting for the oven to heat, cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the pieces of Pizza on the parchment paper. When ready, place the pizza in the oven and as it cooks, the paper will absorb the moisture in the crust, resulting in a crispier textured crust.</p>
